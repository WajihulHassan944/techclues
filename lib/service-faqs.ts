          "a": "A Validation MVP starts from £2,500, a Lean MVP from £5,000 and a Custom or SaaS platform from £10,000. Your price is agreed before any work starts. Not ready for an MVP yet? ZERO.ONE builds and tests your core feature in a week for £499. Our cost calculator gives you an instant estimate."

          "a": "Then you've saved months and most of your budget, and we'll help you work out what to test next."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do I need a technical co-founder?",
          "a": "No. We act as your product and engineering team from validation to launch, and can help you hire in-house when the time is right."
      },
      {
          "q": "Who owns the code?",
          "a": "You do. The code, designs and accounts are yours."
      },
      {
          "q": "What happens after launch?",
          "a": "We review the data with you, fix what users struggle with and plan the next release. You can carry on with us as an ongoing partner."

  "prototype-to-production": [
      {
          "q": "How much does it cost?",
          "a": "The code audit is £750, fixed. The hardening sprint starts from £3,500, and we fix its price at the end of the audit. Book the sprint and the audit fee comes off it."

          "q": "Which tools do you work with?",
          "a": "Apps built with Lovable, Bolt, Replit, Cursor, v0, Windsurf and similar, as well as code written with help from ChatGPT or Claude."
      },
      {
          "q": "Will you rebuild everything?",
          "a": "Only if it's the sensible option. We keep what's sound and fix what isn't, and the audit tells you which before you spend anything more."
      },
      {
          "q": "How long does it take?",
          "a": "The audit takes about a week. Most hardening sprints take 2–4 weeks, depending on what the audit finds."

      },
      {
          "q": "Can I keep building with AI tools afterwards?",
          "a": "Yes. We leave the code organised and tested, so you can carry on with AI tools or with us without breaking what's live."
      },
      {
          "q": "Who owns the code?",
          "a": "You do. The code, accounts and documentation stay yours."

      },
      {
          "q": "Is low-code good enough for real users?",
          "a": "For many products and internal tools, yes. We'll tell you honestly when custom code is the better choice."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can we move to custom code later?",
          "a": "Yes. We design with that path in mind, so the switch is straightforward."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can my team maintain it?",
          "a": "Yes. We train your team and document how everything works."

          "q": "Is my data secure?",
          "a": "We use established platforms and set up user roles and permissions, so people only see what they should."

      {
          "q": "What budget do I need?",

          "q": "How soon will I see results?",
          "a": "Early signals usually show within the first few weeks, then we optimise from there."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you work with pre-launch products?",
          "a": "Yes. Waitlist campaigns are one of the best ways to validate demand."
      },
      {
          "q": "Which channels should I use?",
          "a": "The ones your customers use. We research your audience first, then test the most promising channels with small budgets."
      },

      },
      {
          "q": "Do you build native or cross-platform apps?",
          "a": "Usually cross-platform with React Native or Flutter, so one codebase serves iOS and Android. We'll recommend native when it's genuinely needed."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you take over an existing app?",
          "a": "Yes. We start with a code review, then fix, improve or rebuild depending on what's there."

          "a": "Yes, we handle submission and review for both stores."
      },
      {
          "q": "Which technology do you recommend?",
          "a": "The one that fits your product, team and budget. We explain the options in plain English and recommend what will last, not what's trendy."
      },
      {
          "q": "How do you keep apps secure?",
          "a": "Encrypted connections, secure authentication, role-based access and regular dependency updates, with GDPR in mind from the start."

      },
      {
          "q": "Are you a Shopify Partner?",
          "a": "Yes. Vebryx is a Shopify Partner. We design, build and set up Shopify stores, and build on WooCommerce or custom code where that fits you better."
      },
      {
          "q": "Should I use Shopify, WooCommerce or a custom build?",
          "a": "Shopify suits most shops that want to start selling quickly. WooCommerce suits businesses already on WordPress. A custom build makes sense for marketplaces and buying flows the platforms can't handle. We'll recommend one before we start."

          "a": "Yes. Sellers can sign up, list their products and get paid, while you set the rules, approve listings and take a commission."
      },

          "q": "Can you move my existing shop?",
          "a": "Usually, yes. We'll check what can move from your current platform, such as products, customers and orders, when we scope the work."

      {
          "q": "Which payments can customers use?",
          "a": "Cards and digital wallets through providers such as Stripe, PayPal or Shopify Payments, set up for UK VAT."
      },
      {
          "q": "Who owns the store?",

      },
      {
          "q": "Can you help us get sales after launch?",
          "a": "Yes. Our performance marketing team runs paid social and Google Ads campaigns to bring in customers."

          "q": "How do you test designs?",
          "a": "With clickable prototypes and short sessions with real or target users."
      },
      {
          "q": "How long does design take?",
          "a": "It depends on scope. Design for a focused MVP fits inside the 2–4 week MVP timeline; larger products take longer."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you follow accessibility standards?",
          "a": "Yes. We design to WCAG guidelines, covering contrast, type size, focus states and screen reader support."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you work with our existing brand?",
          "a": "Yes. We'll extend your brand into a product design system, or refine it where it needs help."

      },
      {

          "a": "We can build the software and plan for MHRA guidance where it applies. Regulatory sign-off stays with you and your advisers."

      }
  ],
  "industries-retail-ecommerce": [
      {
          "q": "Do you build on Shopify or custom?",
          "a": "Both routes are possible. We recommend a platform when it fits, and custom builds when you need something it can't do."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you build a marketplace?",
          "a": "Yes, including seller onboarding, split payments, commissions and reviews."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you connect to our stock system?",
          "a": "Yes. We integrate with inventory, ERP and point-of-sale systems through their APIs."

      },
      {
          "q": "How fast can we launch?",

          "q": "Can you help with our pitch?",
          "a": "We can build prototypes and product demos that make your pitch concrete."
      },
      {
          "q": "What if we pivot?",

      {
          "q": "Should we use an off-the-shelf LMS?",

  ],
  "industries-recruitment-staffing": [
      {
          "q": "Can you integrate with our ATS or CRM?",

      },
      {
          "q": "Do you replace legacy systems?",

          "q": "Do you design logos only?",
          "a": "We can, but the best results come from positioning first, then the identity that expresses it."

          "a": "10% of our fees up to £20,000, and 5% of anything above that, up to £5,000 a referral. For monthly services, the same on the first 6 months' fees. A ZERO.ONE earns a flat £50. Pro partners, with 3 or more paid referrals in 12 months, earn 12.5% on the first £20,000. Further work from the same client within 12 months of their first payment earns 5%."
      },
      {
          "q": "How do I register a referral?",
          "a": "Use the \"Refer a client\" form on this page, or email sales@vebryx.co.uk with you and the client both copied, before their first call with us. Only refer people who have agreed to us contacting them. We confirm in writing whether the referral is registered, and the commission it qualifies for."
      },
      {
          "q": "When does a referral count?",
          "a": "When the client is new to us (not in touch with us in the previous 6 months), signs within 6 months of your referral, and pays. If two partners introduce the same client, the first registered referral counts."
      },
      {
          "q": "What counts as fees?",
          "a": "What the client pays us, excluding VAT and third-party costs such as ad spend, hosting, software licences and app store fees. An audit fee that's credited against a build is counted once."
      },
      {
          "q": "When and how am I paid?",
          "a": "By bank transfer in pounds, within 14 days of each client payment clearing. When a project is paid in stages, commission is paid in stages too. Businesses send us an invoice, and you're responsible for your own tax."
      },
      {
          "q": "What if a client cancels or gets a refund?",
          "a": "Commission is due only on what the client pays and keeps paying. If we refund a payment, the commission on it comes off your next payout."
      },
      {
          "q": "What should I tell the people I refer?",
          "a": "That you may earn a referral fee. Please don't promise prices, timelines or results on our behalf: we'll quote after a call."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can the terms change?",
          "a": "We may change the rates for future referrals, with notice. A referral we've registered keeps the commission we confirmed. The full terms come with your welcome email."

          "a": "Book the free 30-minute strategy call. We'll talk through your idea, what you're trying to prove and what it would take to build, and you'll leave with a plan whether or not you work with us."
      },
      {
          "q": "What happens on the first call?",
          "a": "Questions, mostly ours. We want the problem, the people you're building for and the outcome you need. If we're a fit, we follow up with scope, cost and a timeline."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do I need a finished spec before we talk?",
          "a": "No. A paragraph and a rough idea of who it's for is enough. Turning that into a scope is part of what we do."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you work with non-technical founders?",
          "a": "Most of our clients are non-technical. We explain trade-offs in plain terms and never ask you to pick a database."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you take over a product someone else started?",
          "a": "Often, yes. We'll review what exists first and tell you honestly whether it's better to continue it or rebuild the parts that are holding you back."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you work with clients outside the UK?",
          "a": "Yes. We're based in Glasgow and work with founders elsewhere over calls and shared documents; the process doesn't change."
      },
      {
          "q": "How do I know whether to build an MVP or the full product?",
          "a": "If any important assumption is still a guess, build the MVP. If the demand is proven and you're solving a known problem, going straight to the full build can be the cheaper route."
      }
  ],
  "faq-pricing": [
      {
          "q": "How much does an MVP cost?",
          "a": "It depends on the features, the platforms and the pace. The MVP cost calculator gives you a range in a couple of minutes, and the call turns that into a firm number."
      },
      {
          "q": "How accurate is the cost calculator?",
          "a": "It's a planning range, not a quote. It's built from what we've charged for similar work, but the final figure comes after we've scoped your project properly."
      },
      {
          "q": "Why do estimates vary so much between agencies?",
          "a": "Mostly scope and seniority. A cheap quote usually means fewer features, less testing or a junior team; ask anyone quoting you what's excluded."
      },
      {
          "q": "What's included in the price?",
          "a": "Design, development, testing and launch of the scope we agree. Third-party costs like hosting, payment processing or paid AI usage sit outside it."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you charge per project or by the hour?",
          "a": "We price the agreed scope, so you know the figure before we start rather than watching a meter run."
      },
      {
          "q": "How are payments scheduled?",
          "a": "Payment terms are set out in the proposal and tied to milestones, so nothing is due before you've seen progress against it."
      },
      {
          "q": "What happens if the scope changes mid-project?",
          "a": "We tell you what it costs in time and money before anything is built, and you decide. Small changes usually absorb; new features are quoted."
      },
      {
          "q": "Are there ongoing costs after launch?",
          "a": "Hosting, domains and any paid services your product uses are billed by those providers. Ongoing development or support is optional and agreed separately."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you offer payment plans?",
          "a": "Milestone payments already spread the cost across the project. If you need something different, raise it on the call and we'll tell you straight whether it works."

      {
          "q": "How quickly can you launch?",

      },
      {
          "q": "What are the stages of a project?",
          "a": "Eight: Ignition, Compass, Pillar, Canvas, Forge, Bridge, Sentinel and Everest — idea and research, then planning, design, build, integrations, QA and launch."
      },
      {
          "q": "What do you need from me during the build?",
          "a": "Decisions, quickly, and access to anyone who knows your users. An hour a week of your time is typical; slow decisions are the usual cause of slow projects."
      },
      {
          "q": "How often will I hear from you?",
          "a": "Weekly at minimum, with something to look at rather than a status update. You'll have a direct line to the people building it."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you work to a fixed launch date?",
          "a": "Yes, provided the scope can move. Fixed date and fixed scope at the same time is where projects go wrong."
      },
      {
          "q": "What if I need it faster?",
          "a": "We can put more people on it, which costs more per week but shortens the calendar. The calculator's pace options show the effect."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you work in sprints?",
          "a": "We build in short cycles with something reviewable at the end of each one, so you're never waiting weeks to see where the project is."
      },
      {
          "q": "What usually slows a project down?",
          "a": "Waiting on content, waiting on access to a third-party system, and mid-build changes of direction. We flag all three early."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can we start before everything is decided?",
          "a": "Yes. We start with the parts we're sure of and design the rest so that later decisions don't force a rebuild."

  "faq-mvp": [
      {
          "q": "What exactly is an MVP?",
          "a": "The smallest version of your product that tests the assumption your business depends on. Not a demo, not half a product — something real users can complete a real task with."
      },
      {
          "q": "How do you decide what goes into the first version?",
          "a": "We work back from the assumption you need to test. Anything that doesn't help prove or disprove it waits for version two."
      },
      {
          "q": "What if the idea doesn't validate?",
          "a": "Then you've saved the cost of building it. That's the point: we'd rather kill a bad idea in week two than bill you for six months of it."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you do research before building?",
          "a": "Yes. Understanding the users and the existing alternatives is part of the early stages, not an optional extra."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you help us get the first users?",
          "a": "We've run waitlist and launch campaigns alongside builds — Infinite Running League had over 1,000 sign-ups before any code was written."
      },
      {
          "q": "Is MVP code throwaway?",
          "a": "Not the way we build it. It's a smaller product, not a worse one, and it's built so the next version extends it rather than replaces it."
      },
      {
          "q": "What is “Kill my idea”?",
          "a": "A free stress test. You describe the idea, we aim at the customer, the alternatives, the differentiation, the scope and the risks, and tell you what to validate first."
      }
  ],
  "faq-design": [
      {
          "q": "Do you design as well as build?",
          "a": "Yes. UI/UX design and prototyping are part of the process, and we also do brand and identity work when a product needs one."
      },
      {
          "q": "Will I see designs before development starts?",
          "a": "Always. You get a clickable prototype to walk through, so changes happen in design where they're cheap."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you follow our brand or create one?",
          "a": "Either. If you have brand guidelines we work inside them; if you don't, we can create the identity alongside the product."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you test the design with real users?",
          "a": "Yes, that's what the prototype is for. Watching a handful of people use it before we build is the cheapest research there is."
      },
      {
          "q": "What do you design in?",
          "a": "Figma, with Framer and Maze alongside it for prototyping and testing."
      },
      {
          "q": "Is the product accessible?",
          "a": "We build to sensible accessibility standards — contrast, keyboard use, screen-reader labelling — as a default, and we can go further if you're held to a specific standard."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do we get the design files?",

  "faq-technology": [
      {
          "q": "What do you build with?",
          "a": "React and Next.js on the front end, Node, Python or .NET on the back end, PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data, hosted on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or Vercel. Flutter and React Native for mobile."
      },
      {
          "q": "Who chooses the stack?",
          "a": "We recommend, you decide. The choice follows what the product needs and what your team can maintain, not what's fashionable."
      },
      {
          "q": "Do you build mobile apps?",
          "a": "Yes, for iOS and Android. Whether you need one on day one is a different question, and often the answer is no."
      },
      {
          "q": "Web app or mobile app first?",
          "a": "Web first, usually. It's faster to build, easier to change and there's no app store review between you and your users."
      },
      {
          "q": "When do you use low-code or no-code?",
          "a": "When speed matters more than a custom build — internal tools, simple marketplaces, storefronts. We use Shopify, Webflow, Bubble, Softr and automation tools like Zapier, Make and n8n, and we'll tell you when custom code is the better call."
      },
      {
          "q": "Can you integrate with the systems we already use?",
          "a": "Yes. Payments, CRMs, email, maps, analytics and internal APIs are routine; integrations are a stage of our process, not an afterthought."
      },
      {
          "q": "How do you handle security?",
          "a": "Roles and permissions, sensible authentication, encrypted connections, and access limited to what each user needs. If you're handling sensitive data, tell us early so it shapes the architecture."
      },
      {
          "q": "How do you test?",

      },
      {
          "q": "Will it handle growth?",

      },
      {
          "q": "Can you add AI to our existing product?",

      {
          "q": "Which models do you use?",
          "a": "Whichever fits the job — Claude, OpenAI and Gemini models, with LangChain and Hugging Face tooling around them. We'll weigh accuracy, speed and cost per use before recommending one."

          "q": "Is our data used to train someone else's model?",
          "a": "Not with the enterprise and API arrangements we build on, where training on your data is off by default. We confirm the terms of whichever provider you choose before we wire it in."

          "q": "How do you keep AI answers accurate?",

      },
      {
          "q": "What does an AI feature add to the cost?",
          "a": "The build cost is in the calculator; the running cost depends on usage and the model you pick. We'll size both before you commit."

      {
          "q": "Should my MVP have AI in it?",
